= Business Rules
Use the 2 layer comps in  ./assessment.psd for visual layout and style guide.
All icons should be in a sprite image.
Use the styles.css as your external style sheet.
Use javascript and the provided JSON (stats.json) to display all the dynamic content (text) within each section of the module and to add functionality to the tabs "Summary" and "Member page traffic"
You may use dojo or jquery framework if desired.
Bonus - convert the module to render responsively on mobile/tablet and incorporate any animations as you see fit. 

= Features
Clean, linted, valid, commented code follows google style conventions.
Design is responsive, fluid and elastic.
Code meets web performance best practices.
See how I compressed sprite image to 1/3 original size, at https://github.com/bingalls/webGraphicsMagick

= Bugs
Requires Internet Explorer v9 or greater, which includes Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari.
If you must support older browsers, this should work with untested older versions of jQuery.
Code is not minified, for demonstration.

I have an old copy of Photoshop.
The original PSD file had variants of Helvetica Neue. This is not a safe web font, and I do not have a license for it. I chose the closest free font I could find.
I converted the original icons into PNG, but the colors look different.
I could not tell, if the background greys are gradients; I chose solid colors.
